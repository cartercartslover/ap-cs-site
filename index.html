          I learned some basics of coding working with a classmate to create a
          simple color website in snap, for this project I was able to learn how
          to team code together as well as using snaps software.

         This was the final stages of the coding that we did I turned this into 
          the collegebaord with my partner. This was one of my last stages of coding 
          and definetly taught me over all how to really code and of a representation 
          of me.

          like this pico stuff
